### Notes
Studying up on autolayout was useful, since that was something I wanted to use in the tip calculator app. 

I wanted to make it so that the app only displayed the posters and clicking on a poster expanded it so you could see its details. Turns out I was too ambitious, I'll need to work on that later.
